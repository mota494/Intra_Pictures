## How to use

</div>

To start, head over to the users manager page on your intra admin tools and use the filters to set the range of students that you want to pull the images.

Clone this reposotory and open it.

After you download the file in a .csv format and clone the reposotory, copy the .csv file into the `linux` folder if you're on linux or the `windows` folder if you're on windows.

When you're done with that just run the `setup.sh` for Linux or `setup.ps1` for Windows.

After the program has started it will prompt you to fill out your intra credentials, this **doesn't** need to be an admin account 

If you filled out the credentials correctly it will open up a **Google Chrome** window where it will run the script, just leave it while it's doing it's thing

When it's done it will close and leave on the root folder of this repo a file named `final.csv` that will have every link to the students images that can then be used on google sheets per example
